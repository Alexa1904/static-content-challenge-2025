This is a Content Management System internal Acme Co. project, where the management can easily visualize how
a specific .md file looks like;

## Getting Started

First let's install all the dependencies needed

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then run the project

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Content Folder

In the root directory of the project you will find a "content" folder where the .md files will be structured. If you want to see a new section, simply add a new folder (the name has to be different from any existing folder) and include the .md file you want to display. Once added, run the project and select the folder from the available paths or type the name of the folder, with its respective sub-folders if existent, on the navigation bar.
